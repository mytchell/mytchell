<p>Samantha,
I write this knowing that you probably don’t care enough about me to really give a shit about this note. Knowing that for whatever reason, you don’t care at all about me anymore, you don’t love me anymore, and that it was all my fault. That being said, like you, I’m really not sure what else to do other than write you something like this. I re-read your typed letter you wrote me a while ago, and it honestly just hurts. It hurts knowing that I had you all to myself, you were so into me, and I just hurt you and told you that you aren’t worth shit. I know I’m writing this when it might be too late, but god, I really hope it’s not too late. Lately I haven’t wanted to make promises I know I can't keep, because in the end, it just hurts both of us more than anything. It hurts me worse knowing it hurt you. I’ve never felt so distraught about you before, because I’ve always had you right when I need you, but now I honestly do realize that this is the end. I really don’t know why you’re being so apathetic, it’s scary. I’m so unbelievably scared that you’ll leave. I honestly thought that once you got to this point, I’d be glad because I can finally go fuck around and never have to worry about you, but was I wrong. I know that me saying I understand all these things probably doesn’t sound so realistic to you, and sounds like more bullshit as always, but I promise on my life, that this time, I will try. I didn’t think I loved you anymore. I figured it was time for both of us to move on. And it might be, but I can’t yet. I promise I will try harder. I promise we will do stuff, we’ll go out, we’ll do something other than nothing. I promise I’ll try harder to work for you, and I promise I’ll work on not talking about myself. I won’t get mad at you for dumb shit that I usually do, and i’ll listen to your problems anytime you want. I’ll give feedback if you want it, and i’ll keep my mouth shut if you don’t. I love you more than I ever thought I could love somebody. You’re the only person who even remotely likes me and understands me. I managed to throw that away somehow. When I told you about the job, I told you that this is a fresh start. This is my chance to do right, follow the rules, not lie, cheat, or steal. I was so lucky to have such a great life-changing opportunity, and that I have to do everything not to mess it up; it’s the opportunity of a lifetime, and I won’t ever get it again. I didn’t think I’d be speaking the same way of you anytime soon, but now I’m realizing that everything I said about that job, applies to you. You were my chance to do it right, and follow the rules. You were my chance to not lie. I was so lucky to have such a great life-changing girl in my life, and I should have done everything not to mess it up. She’s the opportunity of a lifetime, and I won’t ever get her again. But now i know it’s gone. I know it’s over now. I feel my Layton Mytch, full of depression, anxiety, anger, and hatred, merging with the new Mytch, who was doing so good. And it’s all because I ruined my chance. I ruined all my chances. I felt that way about this new job because so many old jobs had given me a second chance. You’ve given me a lot more than just a second chance. All I can ask for now, is the last chance you’ll ever give me. I knew that I could get you back last time you said it was the last. This time though, it’s way different. And you know that too. I just want my final chance. A chance to do it right, follow your rules, not lie. I’m so lucky to even have you in my life at this point, because I know I won’t ever have you again. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me; you’re my opportunity of a lifetime. I’m still human. I might mess up a few times here or there, it’s only fair to expect as much. But I promise i’ll go out of my way to be as perfect as possible. I love you Samantha. I really didn’t think I needed you as much as I do. Tonight was a wake up call. Just like you wanted. Don’t ever leave please. It’s not going to be worth it without you, and I can honestly say that with everything I have. I’m begging, I’ll do anything. I changed this girl who loved me, into somebody who hated me. "You can pretend as much as you want that I am not the right girl. But I am the best thing that ever happened to you. I care about you more than I care about myself. I loved you unconditionally since the day we met. Through every girl, every fight, every tear, I loved you. I loved you beyond the stars. Hell I loved you like you put the stars in the sky. I did my very best for you ALL OF THE TIME. And one day you're going to realize that. I swear to you, you're going to realize it one day with you with a different me. Because this new girl won't yell at you like I did. She won't alight at your stupid jokes like me. She won't ride through tunnels with you and laughs because she loved it and because she loved you so damn much. She won't get mad at silly things like losing in bowling. She won't invite herself over 24/7, spend your money, beg you for dr. pepper, or get in trouble for you. She won't drink so much NyQuil that you have to take care of her bitch ass. She won't kiss you or tease you like me. And she sure as hell won't love you like I did."
Please be this girl still. I know it will take time, but I promise I’ll work for you more than I ever worked for you, from April 2015, to now, combined. I love you Samantha Harrison. 
Please.
